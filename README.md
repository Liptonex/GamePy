**Never Have I Ever** is a fun and interactive game built using Python and PyGame. It randomly displays prompts from a predefined list, allowing players to engage in the classic "Never Have I Ever" game digitally. The game features a dynamic background color changer and centered text rendering for a visually appealing experience.

## Features

- **Random Prompts**: The game selects random prompts from a text file (`data.txt`) and ensures no prompt is repeated.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background color changes randomly each time a new prompt is displayed.
- **Responsive Design**: The game window is resizable, making it adaptable to different screen sizes.
- **Centered Text Rendering**: Prompts are automatically wrapped and centered on the screen for better readability.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Press the **Spacebar** or **Enter** key to generate a new prompt.

## How to Play

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and PyGame installed. You can install PyGame using pip:
   ```bash

2. **Customize the Prompt File**:
   The game comes with hundreds of preloaded prompts in the `database.txt` file, so you can start playing right away. If you'd like to add your own prompts or modify the existing ones, simply edit the `database.txt` file (one prompt per line). For example:
   ```
   Never have I ever traveled abroad.
   Never have I ever eaten sushi.
   Never have I ever gone skydiving.
   ```
   Feel free to personalize the game with your own creative prompts!


3. **Run the Game**:

   ```bash
   python never_have_i_ever.py
   ```

4. **Play**:
   - The game will display a random prompt.
